  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are compartmentalizing accounts, making multiple identities, and keeping
them separated, you run into a few problems. One of which is remembering the
OPSEC measures you&rsquo;ve decided to employ for each account.</p>

<ul>
<li>Political Dissident

<ul>
<li>Goal: Leak information about a local dirty politician</li>
<li>OPSEC: Work laptop but using a VPN service to access Twitter</li>
<li>Risks: Politician will come after you and your familiy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human Body Part Trafficer

<ul>
<li>Goal: Buy and sell kidneys, livers, and various body parts to the highest
bidder on the black market</li>
<li>OPSEC: Dedicated laptop running an anonymized OS. Do not access any other
services besides the black market forum. Never gets on the Clearnet.</li>
<li>Risks: Law enforcement may find you and throw you in jail for a long time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>In each of these examples you have completely different activities and
completely different risks. The political dissident has decided she only needs
to minimally protect herself as the local politician she&rsquo;s messing with
doesn&rsquo;t have the means to figure out who would be leaking the
information. The body part trafficer though knows that he is a target and has
chosen to protect himself.</p>

<p>What happens when you scale even further: One identity runs a black market
forum, one identity likes to chat with people on twitter, one identity hangs
out in the Anon IRC channels. It&rsquo;s easy to lose track of which identities
are used for what and what kind of OPSEC measures you&rsquo;ve chosen to use.</p>

<p>ne solution to this is to categorize your identities into levels where each
level has its own decided upon OPSEC measure. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Level 0 &ndash; No protections. You don&rsquo;t care about privacy and are
not concerned with other people attributing your online activities to
yourself.</li>
<li>Level 1 &ndash; Minimal: You are concerned about privacy, but choose simple,
minimalist tactics to protect yourself. For example, you are using a VPN
service for everyday browsing, but being caught is inconsequential.</li>
<li>Level 2 &ndash; Medium: You are concerned with your privacy and take action
to ensure that you are safe. It is likely that if someone finds out what you
are doing, you&rsquo;ll have to pay a price, but it is not a life-and-death
situation. For example, journalists working with a source use the TAILS
LiveCD.</li>
<li>Level 3 &ndash; High: Those users that are likely to be targeted, and likely
to have heavy consequences if caught. They have done everything in their
power to maintain their pseudonymity, but still try to lead some semblance of
a personal life.</li>
<li>Level 4 &ndash; Extreme: These are reserved for those people doing high risk
activities where the result of an adversary outing you is a matter of life
and death. You&rsquo;re prepared to forgo personal relationships, worldly
goods, and just about anything to maintain your anonymity.</li>
</ul>


<p>Knowing your likely threats, and defining your level of pseudonymity will help
keep management of your OPSEC measures consistent. Something that recent
arrests seem to have failed at.</p>
