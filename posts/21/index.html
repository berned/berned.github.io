mitigate risk while maintaining operational capabilities'>
As I&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="/blog/2014/01/10/ask-him-about-his-threat-model">before</a>, threat models or risk models help you to define the adversaries you should invest the most resources being concerned about. There are a variety of different risk perspectives you can use to design a
threat model: adversary-centric, asset-centric, or software-centric. We can
adopt these into very similar models for OPSEC plans. Each of these models have
a single principal that operational security&rsquo;s primary goal is to
mitigate risk while maintaining operational capabilities.
</span></p>

<h2>Adversary-Centric OPSEC</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/adversary.png" title="" ></p>

<p>In these types of plans, we&rsquo;re focused on what an attacker or adversary
can do to us; who is coming after you, what they can do, and how you can
defend. An adversary-cetnric policy has the advantage of being much easier to
create and document because many people already think this way. It&rsquo;s very
simple to come up with a list of adversaries that have the potential to affect
what&rsquo;s important to you. The down-side of this approach is that you need
to know your adversaries. In the case of the NSA &ldquo;revelations&rdquo;,
many were shocked to find out that a nation-state had the type of capabilities
that were disclosed. Prior to this, not many were able to mitigate themselves
from these types of threats because they simply didn&rsquo;t know or fully
appreciate an adversary of this nature.</p>

<h2>Asset-Centric OPSEC</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/asset.png" title="" ></p>

<p>This approach focuses on designging mitigations around your assets &ndash; the
things you value the most. If, for example, your asset is your ability to
privately communicate on the Internet, you&rsquo;re going to do everything you
can to ensure no-one can affect this. You&rsquo;re not focused on specific
adversaries per se in this approach, but you are doing everything in your power
to protect yourself. Maybe you&rsquo;re buying a VPN service or using a botnet
or Tor for all communications. Maybe you&rsquo;ve decided that you&rsquo;re
going to try out one of the new <a href="https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page">decentralized</a> <a href="http://dee.su/cables">messaging</a> <a href="https://crypto.cat/">systems</a> as a way of
keeping yourself secure.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of this method is that it&rsquo;s easy to explain why a
measure needs to take place. If you&rsquo;re operating in a group, this may be
an important factor. You can easily make the case that your asset needs to be
secure, therefore we are taking these steps to mitigate the risk. Contrary to
the adversary-centric approach, this is a less passive perspective &ndash; you
are not taking the point of view of being fearful of something happening, you
are merely performing the proactive, required procedures to keep your assets
safe.</p>

<h2>Operation-Centric OPSEC</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/boxes.png" title="" >
This approach, my favorite, lends itself nicely to compartmentalization if
you&rsquo;re managing multiple identities across multiple operations. An
operation in this case could be an identitiy, a research project, an regular
activitiy or whatever, that may require specific operational security measures.
An operation-centreic OPSEC plan may sound recursive to you, but the gist is
that your plans are focused on your specific operation, and that operation
alone. The main difference between this and an asset-centric approach is that
it is designed to have drastically different and compartmentalized procedures
allowing for scalability without letting one operation interfere with another.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever taken a look at the security plans of a large, Fortune 500
company compared to that of a startup, it&rsquo;s quite possible that the
startup is able to implement simple, elegent, effective security plans while
the Fortune 500 spends millions of dollars designing a unilateral security
policy that severely inhibits the organizations operational capabilities. The
reason that a small, agile startup can devise elegant OPSEC measures, is the
same reason that compartmentalizing your OPSEC procedures in an operation-
centric point-of-view is effective.</p>

<p>The other reason that I like this is because it gives you a good balance of a
variety of different OPSEC approaches. You are paying attention to your
operation&rsquo;s assets while taking into account specific adversaries and
their attacks. As you define an operation &ndash; we&rsquo;ll say buying
illegal drugs on the internet &ndash; you will be scoped down to a specific
task and controlled environment. It lets you define boundaries in which your
OPSEC guidelines can define situations in which your measures/countermeasures
no longer protect you. This keeps risks at a minimum because you are only
defending against a subset of your activities &ndash; those associated with the
operation. In the example of buying illegal drugs on a darknet market, your
OPSEC guidelines can state that in the case of the darkmarket collapse (which
seems to happen regularly <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/13/silk-road-2-hacked-bitcoins-stolen-unknown-amount/">lately</a>), your operation should fold and the identity
should be burned. You can take into accounts adversaries such as those that own
the market, and assets you&rsquo;re concerned about such as keeping yourself
out of jail.</p>

<p>I will admit, none of those listed are perfect, nor do they make up an
exhaustive list. They may however give you a starting point for building an
OPSEC plan for yourself.</p>
