<p>I never had the chance to meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#Life_and_works">Aaron_Swartz</a>, but I have been lucky enough to
meet the people of whom&rsquo;s life he affected. <a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/">The Day We Fight Back</a> is a bitter sweet project to me, that helps commemorate Aaron&rsquo;s time on this
planet and the work that put towards improving the online society that we knew
and loved, as well as show the groundswell of community support.</p>

<p>I have no overwhelming feeling that TDWFB will have any direct affect on the
real issues that we are concerned about, but I believe it&rsquo;s important to
support this cause for many reasons. First of which is to show powers-that-be
that there is already a massive, soon-to-be organized community of people who
are willing to fight back for not just the way we interconnect between
computing devices, but for the community that has been created on-top of the
Internet. It&rsquo;s this community that we&rsquo;re hoping to rebuild either
through noble means of change, or on-top of the ashes of the previous
generation.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='there are
people that operate in dark corners, not because of some kind of nefarious
activity they are performing online, but because this is the only legitimate
location where they can feel free to operate'>
I don&rsquo;t usually feel my personal opinions are appropriate for this blog,
but I think that there are a lot of people that have, similar to me, decided to
self-censor and remove their voice from the community. I believe there are
people that operate in dark corners, not because of some kind of nefarious
activity they are performing online, but because this is the only legitimate
location where they can feel free to operate&ndash; a feeling the online
community used to breed by default.
</span></p>

<p>Aaron believed strongly in the openness of information and sharing and
creativity and innovation &ndash; all the tenets of the online community that
we knew. He believed that these values should be upheld at all costs. In his
<a href="https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</a>, there&rsquo;s a quote that is salient beyond
just open access to information, but to privacy, surveillance, and anything
that degrades the online community:</p>

<blockquote><p>“I agree,” many say, “but what can we do? The companies hold the<br/>copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for<br/>access, and it’s perfectly legal" there’s nothing we can do to<br/>stop them.” But there is something we can, something that’s<br/>already being done: we can fight back.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is for Aaron; the days he fought, the fights of today, and the fights that
continue on his behalf.</p>
