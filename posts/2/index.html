<p>I really like learning about new OPSEC tactics, especially if they&rsquo;re done
by the non-tech savvy. Below we talk about the threat model of a Harlem
residents and their defensive tactics.</p>

<h2>Harlem: Surveillance Hipsters</h2>

<p>New York City&rsquo;s, Harlem, is home to the city&rsquo;s lower income population. Not
impoverish but, not Manhattan. Harlem has had an illustrious history being
targeted by NYPD and other forms of law enforcement. Surveillance is part of
every-day life. Who better to give us some perspective on dealing with mass
surveillance on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>Harlem residents aren&rsquo;t concerned about NSA or GCHQ. They have a local
surveillance issues to deal with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Surveillance from their employers who install cameras to watch them work.</li>
<li>Surveillance from the local NYPD who have installed street cameras on the
corners that they know are not installed in Manhattan.</li>
<li>Surveillance from ex-boyfriends on Facebook who are keeping track of who
they talk with or what parties they go to.</li>
</ul>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='You
might not find their tactics useful, but it serves as a remember that
OPSEC is dependent on the threat model.'>
They have a different threat model compared to the nation-state dissident. You
might not find their tactics useful, but it serves as a remember that
OPSEC is dependent on the threat model. Someone hiding from the government
employs different tactics than someone hiding from their ex-boyfriend. The
threats are one in the same.
</span></p>

<h2>Family Plan Surveillance</h2>

<p>The US has &ldquo;Family Plans.&rdquo; These are cell
phone plans that you share with trusted friends and family to
can keep your bill to a minimum. But what happens when you no longer trust
someone on the plan? You don&rsquo;t kick them off. You ignore them. It&rsquo;s cheaper.</p>

<p>For some of these sketchy carriers, a member of the plan can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get access to a backup of the phone&rsquo;s contact lists</li>
<li>Read text messages</li>
<li>Get the call records for the account</li>
<li>Track the location of a phone using a &ldquo;Find My Phone&rdquo; app</li>
</ul>


<p>This is their threat. On a day-to-day basis they aren&rsquo;t worried about the FBI
cracking down on them, they&rsquo;re worried about their ex-boyfriend stalking them.</p>

<h2>Social Lions</h2>

<p>We know that LEO&rsquo;s will keep track of social networking in their jurisdiction.
NYPD has invested millions to keep track of this effort. This is done in one
of a few ways. Most common of which, NYPD will make a request to Facebook for
access to a specific facebook account. I&rsquo;m told that 80%-90% of the time,
Facebook does not contest these requests and as long as it&rsquo;s coming from an
attributable law enforcement office, they&rsquo;re provided without any oversight.</p>

<p>The other more nefarious <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/10/7341077/nypd-harlem-crews-social-media-rikers-prison">tactic that NYPD specifically uses</a> is to generate
fake accounts and target individuals in the neighbor hood. Keep track of their
friends, watch what parties they go to, see what people are talking about.</p>

<p>The people in these neighborhoods know this is happening in the same way that
they know the street cameras in the streets are keeping track of them.</p>

<h2>Harlem OPSEC</h2>

<p>For the non-tech savvy, their tactics are brilliant. They include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Emoji-contacts</strong>: Never saving their friends names in their phone. Use emoticons instead. Smiley
face is a new boyfriend. Cake is your friend from the club. Happy penguin is
your pot dealer.</li>
<li><strong>Never using iPhones</strong>: They don&rsquo;t trust these devices and their tracking
capabilities. Instead use a cheap Android device they feel can&rsquo;t track them
as accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t use SMS</strong>: Use messaging apps like snapchat for messages with new boyfriends. They know
that these are protected and don&rsquo;t show up on the records for the account.</li>
<li><strong>Watch Out Who Friends You</strong>: They believe that the NYPD is &ldquo;Cat Fishing&rdquo;
them to learn about their social circles and keep track of things they post
that might be illegal.</li>
</ul>


<p>Look, these aren&rsquo;t tactics that a tech-savvy person would use, but they show
real-world examples of different kinds of threats and ways to compensate for them.</p>
