  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever seen one of those arguments on forums or IRL where a group of
people argues which scenario is more secure compared to another? It goes
something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey, how secure is Cloud? Should I use that?"<br/> Alice: Cloud is fine. I just wouldn't save your passwords in it.<br/> Bob: Actually, Cloud is really dangerous. If someone hacks into your<br/>account they'll be able to get everything that you own in the<br/>Cloud.<br/> Carl. It's worse than that! The cloud should never ever be used<br/>under any circumstance. It is inherently insecure.<br/> Doug: People that use the cloud should be removed from this earth.</p></blockquote>


<p>These are usually escalating arguments that try to pretend that if you have
some higher level of security measures in place, it&rsquo;s a sign of wisdom. The
truth is, every answer is wrong because they don&rsquo;t have enough information to
intelligently make a recommendation. What should have been asked is &ldquo;What
is your threat model?&rdquo; Or put simply, what are you legitimately concerned
about. A nation-state, hunting you down for disclosing its secret, or are you
just kind of concerned about your privacy without doing activities with life
ending repercussions?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve heard that IT guy tell you the story about how &ldquo;The most secure
computer is the one that&rsquo;s turned off, put in a locked room, and filled
with cement&rdquo; usually followed up by another IT guy adding in some other
obscene logistic. Yes this is secure, but it&rsquo;s not a real-world solution
because most computers have operational requirements.</p>

<p>Step away from technical examples &ndash; let&rsquo;s take the United States
Secret Service for instance. Their job is to protect the United States
President from a variety of adversaries. If your job was to protect the
President, why not just put him in a locked room padded with cement and keep
him there until the end of his term? Because he has operational requirements.
This is the rub of all operational security measures.</p>

<p>You can apply this to your lives. You shouldn&rsquo;t be asking how much you
care about security, you should be asking what is the biggest threat to your
well being. If you&rsquo;re just concerned about your privacy, but someone
attributing you to your activities results in embarrassment (as opposed to jail
time), then maybe your operational security measures can be more relaxed and
comfortable. They might even fit in with your current lifestyle.
If you&rsquo;re a nation state dissident and your activities being attributed
to you results in your death, your operational security measures are going to
be extremely high and would require a disciplined, rigid approach.</p>
