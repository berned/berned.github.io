<div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="/blog/2014/01/13/braintricks-opsec/">wrote_previously</a> wrote previously about using your brain to help
compartmentalize you various identities. This is still a common thread of
research I&rsquo;m working on and wanted to further expand on the idea. The
short version of my previous post was that if you can create a completely
different operating environment for each of your operations/activities,
you&rsquo;ll be able to more easily maintain whatever OPSEC measures
you&rsquo;ve employed.</p>

<h2>Event Boundaries</h2>

<p>Event Boundaries is a theory that has come to my <a href="http://www.memory-key.com/blog/event-boundaries-and-working-memory-capacity">attention</a> recently. The
concept is simple &ndash; when you walk through a boundary such as a door,
gate, or different space, your brain automatically switches from its previous
mode of operation, to a new one. This is the reason that when you walk into a
room, you sometimes completely forget why you&rsquo;re there. The point to
focus on here is that the boundary defines a beginning and an end of an
environment.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='When your brain knows there is a beginning and an end, studies show that this
helps to create a compartment for those memories.'>
When your brain knows there is a beginning and an end, studies show that this
helps to create a compartment for those memories. We can use this to our
advantage. In a perfect world, we could make physical barriers for each of our
identities so that when we switch to another operation, we switch operating
environments. Some realistic examples could be that Identity A always operates
in Starbucks coffee shops, while Identity B always operates in the local
library.
</span></p>

<h2>Logical Event Boundaries</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re confined to your own apartment, or have a static operating
environment, you&rsquo;re going to be left to tricking your brain into creating
logical event boundaries instead. One way to do this is to create an induction
procedure for that operation. Before you being working in that operating
environment, you must follow the same exact steps you&rsquo;ve done previously.
This should take into account as many senses as you can.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/eventboundaries.png" title="" ></p>

<p>For example, you can create a video that is a compilation of various images; a
river, a mountain, an urban scene, and a zoo &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter
the scense, but they need to all be in the same &ldquo;mood&rdquo; if you will
(ie. a gun fight is not the same mood as a running river). Specific sounds or
music are set in the background of the video. Whenever it&rsquo;s time to
assume that identity, you adjust the lights in the room to be very bright, you
put on your headphones, fire up that identities computer, and watch that video.
Following these steps, while you haven&rsquo;t physically entered a room, you
have logically created an event boundary that helps your brain to process and
recall that identity&rsquo;s operating environment.</p>

<p>When exiting, you must do something similar, but it cannot be the same process
as the way you entered. (Because you&rsquo;re creating the event of leaving the
room which has a much different feeling than entering.) Create a new video
consisting of a different mood and different music. I would suggest something
drastically different than your operating environment. If you normally work
quiet, create a loud video with lots of action. Finally, adjust the lights in
the room so that are at their previous state.</p>

<p>Even as I write this, I feel that this may seem over-the-top or ridiculous. I
might not disagree with over-the-top for what you&rsquo;re doing, but the
results are tangible. The point of all this is, if you work to maintain
multiple operations or multiple identities with different operating
requirements, this process can help (at least for me) to:</p>

<ul>
<li>compartmentalize each operation so that it does not interfere with your
personal life</li>
<li>maintain consistency for whatever OPSEC measures you employ</li>
<li>recall how that identity is supposed to act online</li>
</ul>
