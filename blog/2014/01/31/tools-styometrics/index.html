<div class="entry-content"><p>Stylometrics is the idea that your writing style can be quantified, even
fingerprinted. The way you turn a phrase, the average word or sentence length,
the vocabulary used, all contribute to a a scientific perspective of your
writing style. In terms of OPSEC, stylometrics is an adversarial concern
&mdash; one of which can be difficult to defend against.</p>

<p>One of the operational security measures that Edward Snowden employed, was to
write short bits of information; small paragraphs, a few sentences, but never
long prose. This was, in part, because he had concerns that no matter what kind
of anyonymity systems or security tactics taken, if an adversary with enough
power was able to extract the plain text from one of his messages, it could be
correlated back to himself based on previous documents he had written.</p>

<blockquote><p>Snowden was not yet ready to tell me his name, but he said he was<br/>certain to be exposed &#8220;by his own hand or somebody else&#8217;s.&#8221;&#8221; Until<br/>then, he asked that I not quote him at length. He said semantic<br/>analysis, another of the NSA&#8217;s capabilities, would identify him by<br/>his patterns of language.</p></blockquote>


<p>Barton Gellman <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/code-name-verax-snowden-in-exchanges-with-post-reporter-made-clear-he-knew-risks/2013/06/09/c9a25b54-d14c-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html">Washington Post Snowden Communications</a></p>

<p>Also to note, this is not merely an NSA capability, intelligence compaies like
Palantir posses this capabibility and wrap it into the products that they
offer.</p>

<p>In 2007, researchers for the <a href="http://readwrite.com/2008/02/14/spidering_the_dark_web">Univesity of Arizona</a>, scraped the Deep Web blogs,
forums, and anything else they could get their hands on, in an attempt to
attribute people. They crawled forums run by neo-nazis and devised a way of
taking all that information, and separating out who was who on the forums. They
used stylometrics to collect enough information to group people up based on a
variety of features.</p>

<h2>Types of stylometrics</h2>

<p>There are two ways in which stylometrics can be used against you. (Both of them
have their names borrowed from an approach to Natural Language Processing.) One
way, which is called &ldquo;Supervised,&rdquo; refers to taking a group of
documents with known authors, and attributing them to an unknown author. For
instance if we had a writing sample from Edward Snowden, we could attempt to
attribute his authoriship of something he anonymously posted, by comparing his
writing styles. This type is relatively easy for humans to do themselves.</p>

<p>The second type, &ldquo;Unsupervised,&rdquo; leverages computational power to
take a pile of anonymous blocks of text, and group them together based on the
writing style. The example, the neo-nazi forum research didn&rsquo;t identify
individuals posting to the forum, but they grouped which posts belonged to
NaziA and which posts belonged to NaziB.</p>

<h2>What makes up your style</h2>

<p>There are dozens of models that deliver a perspective on your writing style.
They&rsquo;ve been created by academics and all aim to be more accurate than
the next. One called the &ldquo;9 Feature Model&rdquo; is merely taking nine
properties like sentence length, unique words, a readability index, and some
other simple to measure features of the text to come out with a classification.</p>

<p>Other, more complex methods like the &ldquo;Writeprints&rdquo; method, use
hundreds of features to make their conclusions. I&rsquo;m simplifying this to
features classifiers, but these are actually extremely complicated models using
neaural nets to generate their results.</p>

<h2>Evasion tactics</h2>

<p>If we see this as a threat, we need to mitigate. Researchers who <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2019_28C3-authorship.pdf">presented at 28C3</a> define a few ways in which to evade being finterprinted:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Obfuscation</strong>: Generally make the text appear unlike your normal writing
 style.</li>
<li> <strong>Imitation</strong>: Make your writing stile look like someone elses.</li>
</ol>


<p>(They also recommend what they call &ldquo;Translation&rdquo; which is merely
taking a text, using an automatic translator service to convert it to a
different language, and then change it back. I don&rsquo;t see any difference
between this and &ldquo;Obfuscation&rdquo; and it presents a new anonymity
issue.)</p>

<h2>Tool: Anonymouth</h2>

<p>These researchers even gave us some data that shows how effective each type of
mitigation is to defend against. They show us a break down of the stylometric
model employed, and how effective each type of evasion tactic was. They also
give us a tool to help us anonymize our own documents that works surprisingly
well. Althought it&rsquo;s very complicated.</p>

<p>There are a lot more details about how the tool works and when to use it, but
for now, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/psal/anonymouth">Anonymouth</a>. This is a Java tool that takes the document you&rsquo;d like to anonymize, compares it to other documents
you&rsquo;ve written, and then takes a variety of texts from other others to
compare against. The results give you a breakdown of common words you use,
attributing sentence structure, and even some suggestions about how to change
the document to defend against attribution.</p>

<p>As this is an Academic research tool, it&rsquo;s written in Java and awkward to
use, but in general, it is pretty effective. They are now working to automate
many of its features so that instead of manually anonymizing a document, you
can tell the tool a directory of documents that you&rsquo;d like to anonymize.</p>
