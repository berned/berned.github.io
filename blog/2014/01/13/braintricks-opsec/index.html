<div class="entry-content"><p>Creating different usernames is just the first step when we&rsquo;re developing an
OPSEC plan for pseudonymity. One of the most plausible threats to your privacy/anonymity/pseudonymity is one where the adversary correlates a personality
trait across all of your accounts.</p>

<p>In 2011, researchers from University of Cambridge published details in how to
correlate traffic patterns of a Tor user, to their real life identity. They did
this by taking advantage of the fact that most people visit a certain set of
websites on a regular basis. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, or some specific site
of interest. This is an example where an attacker is taking advantage of a
personality quirk to attribute you to your identity.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='SDM is when the
human brain compartmentalizes certain memories based on the state-of-mind of
that person'>
Your writing style is also something attributable. You may know that certain
adversaries have the ability to do correlation attacks on your writing style
(or at least Edward Snowden thinks so). Taking something that you&rsquo;ve written
anonymously and matching it to something you&rsquo;ve written in the clear.
The idea of State-Dependant Memory (SDM) can help us here. SDM is when the
human brain compartmentalizes certain memories based on the state-of-mind of
that person. While in that state-of-mind or consciousness, memories are harder
or easier to recall. Think of this like a lock box for your memories.  A common
example of this is studying for a test at a University. Before your exam, you
study in the room you&rsquo;ll be taking the test, at the time of day you&rsquo;ll be
taking the test, at the same desk that you will be using. When you go to take
your exam, your brain will flip into the state that you&rsquo;ve trained it for,
making it easier to recall those memories.
</span></p>

<p>You can apply this as a management tactic for you pseudonymity. For each
identity that is created, design a state of mind for that user. Your
consciousness can be adjusted using a combination of one of your human inputs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Music/Audio: play certain music, certain songs, certain albums or look into a
specific meditation album that can put you into a specific, reproducable
state of mind. (See Robert Monroe&rsquo;s tapes)</li>
<li>Environment: It might not be possible to switch keyboard, monitor, or desktop
environment you normally work under but changing where you work has a huge
impact. Find a public place that your identity always goes, or sit in a
specific area of your apartment.</li>
<li>Lighting/Colors: Studies have shown that lighting and the colors of that
light have a drastic impact on the mood and state of being. This could be as
simple as having a light on or off while working, changing the color scheme
of the monitor, or closing the blinds for a window.</li>
<li>Drugs/Chemicals: When trying to reach a state of mind, you&rsquo;d be hard
pressed to find a faster, more consistent way to get into a reproducible
state. Many stimulants like caffeine, Ridilin, and cocaine, have a common
affect on people where taking something like LSD may not give you
reproducible results.</li>
<li>Smells: As we&rsquo;re going through all the senses, don&rsquo;t forget smell. Simply
lighting a specific candle or type of incense can take you into the place
that you need to be.</li>
<li>Time: Being aware of the time of day and when the identity works, is not just
helpful to bring you to a specific state of consciousness, it can also help
deter adversaries from being able to tell what timezone you live in.</li>
</ul>
