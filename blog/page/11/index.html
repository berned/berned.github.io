  <div class="entry-content"><p>When Dread Pirate Roberts was caught, there was a lot of talk about all of his
OPSEC failures. Specifically how he had used a pseudonym to reference another
pseudonym&rsquo;s email address, letting investigators tie together the
activities of both of those accounts.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve heard it time and time again that we need to
&ldquo;compartmentalize&rdquo; our lives and identities and never let them
touch. For most, this is easier said that done but here are a few thoughts on
making it easier.</p>

<h2>Start From Scratch</h2>

<p>When he started out, DPR probably didn&rsquo;t realize that his darkmarket
forum would take off as well as it did, and he probably didn&rsquo;t know he
was going to be such a juicy target for law enforcement. So he had made some
pseudonyms and was doing some research without paying much attention.
What we should learn is that, when it&rsquo;s time to go dark, there is no
looking back; we have to start from scratch. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how
popular you have become under one of your other nyms and how much community
&ldquo;cred&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve earned thus far, you have to drop it all.</p>

<p>Start from scratch and decide what you&rsquo;re doing. Make up new accounts,
and document your adversaries that you need to plan for. If you think you might
ever accidentally cross back over, burn those accounts. Generate new passwords
and forget them. Don&rsquo;t let yourself ever log into them again.</p>

<h2>Lose the Ego</h2>

<p>Starting from scratch also means accepting that, in some ways, you&rsquo;ve
completely wasted your time. The previous accounts you&rsquo;ve created can
never be used for what you other accounts are doing. You can send a private
message to your friends saying, &ldquo;Hey, this is actually
Th3D@rkDru1d&rdquo; because no matter how much you trust them, they will have
become a liability.</p>

<p>You can see this issue again coming into play with DPR. He writes about how he
is rich and powerful and feels limitless. It was his final power move of trying
to kill someone that actually took him down the hardest.</p>

<h2>Know Your Identity</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re creating more than one identity, you need to be able to know
that person inside and out. Names, addresses, background history, social
network, common websites. Even things like writing style and personality type.
All of these are tools that an adversary could use to correlate your accounts.</p>

<h2>Real Life is its Own Identity</h2>

<p>Your real life identity should be your most prized possession. It&rsquo;s the
most difficult one to burn, you can&rsquo;t just start from scratch, and most
do not want to cut ties with their personal relationships. So this is the one
you should protect the most.</p>

<p>One of the most common mistakes is tie your real life identity, to an online
pseudonym. It&rsquo;s becoming popular for &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;security researchers&rdquo; to share all their projects and information;
some of which is illegal. Technically, port scanning an un-owned host is
illegal but it&rsquo;s one of those accepted things like speeding. As
&ldquo;hackers&rdquo; are becoming famous at things like Defcon, Blackhat, and
any of the other thousands of security conferences, the reward for disclosing
things to the public is higher. This makes them make riskier decisions to get
that fame.</p>

<h2>Know Your OPSEC</h2>

<p>Decide on your OPSEC measures. Figure out what you&rsquo;re going to do to
protect yourself and your identities. Each of your risky online activities will
usually require its own separate OPSEC measures. Keep them divided, but keep
them consistent.</p>
